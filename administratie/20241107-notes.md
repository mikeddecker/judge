A little summary

A communication channel for the 3 of us (Dylan, Pieter, Mike) \
Share screen sketches

## Topic discussion

Focus = DD3. How?

1) Jumper Localisation
2) Skill segmentation, start of skill, end of skill
3) Counting rotations (DU, TU, QU, Wrap with 3 rotations?) =/= DD
4) ... (unknown in betweens)
5) Label the effective skill

## Project info

- Data
- Physical systems
- Papers & Models

### Data

Current estimation of data: 440GB

Includes mostly SR2, SR4, DD3, DD4, already some SR singles.

Includes:

- Belgium 2022 Big Nationals
- Belgium 2023 Team Nationals
- Belgium 2024 Team Nationals

- Some freestyles

TODO : scrape YT subscribed channels (clubs, virtual world championships, WC livestreams...)
TODO : scrape insta videos (=mainly SR)

### Physical devices

Laptop: GPU (not ideal, but good for try-outs)
School: Ask for server (with GPU)

TODO : use pytorch

### Resources (Papers & Models & additional sources)

Resources becomes a folder/file like paperlinks.md to store thoughts and summaries about papers. (The thinking process.)

Possible usage of [Jumphabet](https://www.natekg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jumphabet-File.pdf)

RepNet: https://sites.google.com/view/repnet (we use a modified version of this for NextJump, could be used for trick segmentation or multiple under counting)

NextJump online demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanplummer/NextJump (demo showing some basic "jump type" detection e.g double under, triple unders, jogging step)

DensePose for multi-person segmentation from videos: http://densepose.org/ (we have tested this as a backbone for freestyle representations)

Sam2 for prompted video segmentation: https://ai.meta.com/sam2/ (could be useful for labeling jumpers and ropes from videos)
