# BP promotor first meeting : feedback proposal

## Research question

Reformulate so it will not be a yes-or-no-question. \
Literaly state question, watch out, he was more or less unintended at the end of the introduction as a yes or no question.

## Meer references introduction

Remarks/feedback from Research methods last year still apply. Introduction, more resources.

Ideas:

- Speed record history (to substantiate statement evolution of the sport) --> Create table history (as yet to find one)

- Split problem and solution domain more explicit

## Language component

> "Admissible under conditions", mostly because of language.
> English paper, but some titles, subtitles or parts of the text still remained Dutch.

(Already submitted the proposal last year in the preparative course, didn't plan enough time this year, didn't wanted to just translate, so the extra literature slobbed my time, meanwhile the deadline was nearing. Submitted 23h55.)

## Literature study

How much more depth? \

The literature, introduction and methodology are already really extensive for a proposal.
Only the literature about the problem domain is a little missing. (Already mentionned some parts in the introduction)

> -> Shift around a little between intro & literature.

Personal note: Extend part about ConvLSTM & Transformers as it seems to be the primary techniques of the AI Judge, but only shortly stated.
E.g. 2.6.1, 2.6.2... ConvLSTM, Transformers, VisionTransformers.

## Confidentialiteit continued

Other continued question: Confidentiality continued, hoe public is the defending of the paper in june?
Confidentiality: Specific attachments can be made confidential and still be referenced.
Repo will be public
Presentation at the end of the year is 'public' as in, the jury, (co-)promotor, an expert in the field. Other students not allowed. Not recorded or so.
(Training data not required to be public)

## Feedback Research Methods last year

personal languagge (we, appealing the readers by mentioning 'you')

The other parts of RM last year seem to be adapted or already mentioned in this summary.
