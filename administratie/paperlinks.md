Possible usage of [Jumphabet](https://www.natekg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jumphabet-File.pdf)

RepNet: https://sites.google.com/view/repnet (we use a modified version of this for NextJump, could be used for trick segmentation or multiple under counting)

NextJump online demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dylanplummer/NextJump (demo showing some basic "jump type" detection e.g double under, triple unders, jogging step)

DensePose for multi-person segmentation from videos: http://densepose.org/ (we have tested this as a backbone for freestyle representations)

Sam2 for prompted video segmentation: https://ai.meta.com/sam2/ (could be useful for labeling jumpers and ropes from videos)
