## Topic

Recognition of jump rope skills based on videographic material.

## Mail

Dear Andrej Kyselica,

(mail also provided in mardown format)

## Who am I?

I'm Mike De Decker, a 22 years old student at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Flanders Belgium. (dutch abreviation: HOGENT)
My line of study is Applied Information Technologie - specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Data engineering

I'm jumping the rope for over half my life, now more addictive then ever as it's my second year B-level competition in Belgium and judging experience.

## Why this information?

For my undergraduate course, we must research an actual case as an undergraduate thesis. (Not a theoretical or academic, but one taken from the field, an applied one, in which we as students are not yet experts.)

As a subject, I'd like to recognize Double Dutch Single (DD3) skills from recorded video material to assist judges at competitions in our growing sport.

## Acceptence criteria

For our thesis to be accepted, we need to comply with certain conditions. Such as a concrete, specific problem; it is a research question; there is a clear investigative component; a solid technical component; SMART... and a co-promotor/co-supervisor assisting the student as an expert in the field. (preferably computer vision)

Through the NextJumpApp and Pieter Gibens, one of Belgium's head judges, I came to ask you the question: Would you or one of your NextJumpApp peers like to be my co-promotor for my bachelor thesis?

## More information

### The AI judge

The goal of the artificial judge is to recognize jump rope skills through computer vision, mainly focussed on DD3, which will be a base for other disciplines.

This way, judges can verify or edit jumped skills/combinations/scores live at a competition to improve the reliability of ranking given to jumpers.

### First research - current main flow

Last year we had a preparative course called Research Methods in which we learned how to do research and where we already admitted a possible research proposal. I already knew my topic, so I already did some research last year which I can extend for my proposal and applied thesis this year.

To keep it simple and omitting multi actors disciplines like single rope pairs, I came to the following three main goals:

- Locate the jumpers in the frame (As one unit - DD3 acts as a team)
- Recognize the start and end frame of a skill.
- Recognize the whole skill

All three would be using deep neural networks. Winners of last year research were CNNs and convLSTMs in addition to some abbreviations, a self-attention convLSTM and a memory-in-memory model or YOLO as other possibilities. Multiple models can be testen if time allows it.

### Roles

(Mostly literal translation from the thesis guidelines, aided by Deepl and Grammarly)

Promotor: A teacher at school, allocated 6th December

- following and ensuring the quality of the thesis
- general feedback and evaluation of the thesis
- checking administrative things like deadlines & appointments
- being a judge at the defending presentation of the thesis and allocating a score (+/- 50 minutes in June or August/early September if the submission was not accepted)

Co-promotor:

- Helping to find qualitative and professional literature
- discuss requirements (if applicable to the topic)
- give content-related feedback on the research proposal and
intermediate results (on my initiative)
- serve as a member of the jury (reading jury and presentation) and evaluate the bachelor thesis through a short report.

International person allowed, (needs to be approved by head thesis co√∂rdinator), on this occasion, an English thesis can be approved and defending of the thesis can be done through a videocall.

Student:

- Research, writing, methodology, building Proof of Concept... 
- Following deadlines
- ...
- update unique skill names
- update table variant skills

Pieter Gibens:

- Clearing up rope-skipping judge-related questions
- Playing the 'client' of the product, like expected results?
- Discuss national and international accepted notation of skills that I'll use to label skills.
  - Providing international skill-list naming conventions
  - (I made sort of a pointified notation for skills e.g. TU.s.AS.o)
- Discus table variant of the unique skill names
  - which the neural network can use to learn skills

### Timeline

The school provided us with a main timeline (I included the team competitions, as the PoC preferably needs to be ready by then.)
The first semester will be used to write a proposal, adjusted based on feedback and making an appointment with the promotor.

- 24th of January - final version of proposal + deadline for having a co-promotor. (Filling in a paper and uploading, I'll ask if there are English versions of thesis guidelines and such if you're interested)
- 22nd of February (12-15 years A-team competition)
- 7th of March - submit the introduction, literature & methodology of the thesis itself
- Rest of March - feedback + 2 major Team competitions (A-level teams 16years+ & national teams contest)
- 27th or 28th of April - BC-level 16+ teams
- 2nd of May - final draft of thesis.
- 23rd of May - submit the thesis.

So between the competitions of March and April, there is some time to adjust my models. Afterwards, in May not so much time or new competitions to test out, unless I search other countries for test results. This means my PoC needs to be ready by March.

Due to a personal trajectory, I have more time in my second semester than others, 3-4 days a week. Not that there is enough time at hand.

## Conclusion

A challenging project, in a fun context.
Would you or one of your NextJumpApp peers like to be my partner in crime and see the possibilities of AI in Jump Rope or would you like more information, I'm happy to provide more information. (written or videocall).

By jumpers for jumpers.

Greetings from Belgium,
Mike De Decker
